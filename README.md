### :scream: Every even number greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two prime numbers.

Goldbach's conjecture is one of the oldest unsolved problems in number theory.

The image shown shows the number of ways in which a number n can be written as a *sum of two primes* for n â‰¤ 1 000 000.

For example:
*  4 = 2 + 2
*  6 = 3 + 3
*  8 = 3 + 5
* 10 = 3 + 7 = 5 + 5
* 12 = 5 + 7
* 14 = 3 + 11 = 7 + 7
